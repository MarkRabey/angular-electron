# AngularElectron

Scaffolding for Electron Apps using Angular.

## Getting Started

Clone repository to your project folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:MarkRabey/angular-electron.git my-project
```

Change to project directory and remove `.git` folder:

```
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
```

To keep using Git (with your own commit history), either run `git init` to create a new repository for the project, or add the remote for your existing repo.

Update values in `package.json` to match your project/product.

Update `README.md` with details for your project.

## Scripts

- `npm start` - just use this.
